                            third-party service provider acting on Our behalf to transmit the mobile messages within the

                            thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to

                            determined by arbitration in New York, New York before one arbitrator.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in
                            accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
                            then in effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive
                            laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which Eshop, Inc.,’s principle place of business is
                            located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar days after the
                            arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with at
                            least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the
                            subject matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10)
                            calendar days, a party may petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same
                            experience requirement. In the event of a dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the
                            enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the Federal
                            Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing Emergency
                            Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court.
                            The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of
                            appeal except for those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of
                            the fees paid for the arbitrator and the administration of the arbitration; however, the
                            arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to pay all or any portion of such fees as
                            part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority
                            to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or contract. The
                            arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any
                            right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration.
                            The parties agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit
                            class arbitration or any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or
                            representative arbitration proceeding. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor the
                            arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration without the prior
                            written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right. If any term or
                            provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
                            invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
                            Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.
                            If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby
                            waive any right to a jury trial. This arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or
                            termination of your agreement to participate in any of our Programs.</span></p>

                            will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of either party to
                            exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further
                            rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
                            that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this
                            Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features,
                            changes, updates or improvements of the Program shall be subject to this Agreement unless
                            explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right to change this Agreement from time
                            to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. You acknowledge your

                            unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to
                            the fullest extent under law. The failure of the Company to enforce any right or provision in
                            this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and
                            agreed to by the Company in writing. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between you
                            and the Company and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or
                            agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the subject matter contained
                            herein. Nothing in this Agreement allows any party who is not a party to this Agreement to have
                            any rights under this Agreement nor be able to enforce this Agreement.</span></p>
