                    <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:<br>- “Cookies” are data files that
                        are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more

                        (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with
                        invoices and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:<br>-
                        Communicate with you;<br>- Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and<br>- When in line with
                        the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our

                        generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the
                        success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>
